                Best School is a great school finding website and has supported both of my boys education. The teachers are engaged and caring. The staff is friendly and supportive. The PTO works with the school and we have great events and activities that support the school.

                We love Best School. The sense of community is very strong from the front desk, teachers and leadership. People really care about the kids in this school. There are several schools closer to our home. We drive extra distance to Monarch, because the staff has developed a bond with our kids. We appreciate them very much and like the Montessori approach.
